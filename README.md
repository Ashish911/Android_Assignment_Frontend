Retrofit is a REST Client for Android and Java that makes the data retrieval and uploading of JSON through a REST based webservice. 
In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom 
converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library faor HTTP requests.
  Its uses are:
 1. It helps to convert JSON value to GSON format
 2. It helps the application to link with the API 
 3. It helps the application to communicate with backend api
